# Second-Assignment Report!

## Introduction
- This application is made to give us the temperature and humidity of a city\
by taking the name of the city. 
- The purpose of this assignment is probably to learn how to work with Git and GitHub.

## Design and Implementation
- In this program, I did not use any special data structure except
that I got acquainted with json data structure.
- The algorithm I used in this question was to take the city name as a string and then
give it to two functions that return the temperature and humidity of that city.
At the beginning,
I entered the API Key that it can connect with the Weather site.
- The challenge I faced was working with Git because it was my first time using it
and I didn't know its commands.

## Testing and Evaluation
- To check if the program works properly and gives the right output,
I gave it the city of Tehran as input
and it returned its temperature and humidity as output.
##  Conclusion
- I learned to work with Markdown
and it was beautiful and simple and of course practical.
- Actually , I don't see any strong point because I didn't do anything special,
but there was a lot of way to improve the solution and increase its strengths.
next time Inshallah!
