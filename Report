Introduction:
The assignment was to write a code that can get some data related to the weather of a city.
The objectives were learning to work with git and using the json data in java and also using
gradle or maven as package managers.
Design and Implementation:
In this assignment we first get the city name as a string and also get the api key from a site
called weatherapi which shares info about the weather of the cities live.
We use double for temperature and int for humidity.
We pass the api key and city to the getWeatherData function which return a string in which there
is information about the given city.
Then we use JSONOBJECT to retrieve the data given by the server and use answer to return the number
The biggest challenge was to work with the JSON and how to use it.
Testing and Evaluation:
The testing part was pretty straightforward because we knew we needed to get two numbers from the
compiler and it worked as so.
The only challenging part about the results was the time and how long it took for the server to
respond. It sometimes took it several minutes to give an answer.
Conclusion:
The best thing about the assignment was learning to word with JSON and the most frustrating part
was to work with git which I think a little more teaching would have been perfect.
