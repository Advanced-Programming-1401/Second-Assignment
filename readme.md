# Weather App Assignment

## Introduction
-this assignment is an application that give us a brief information(humidity,tempreture) of a given city.

## design and implementation
- i used gradle and json for handling the data that computer recives from the wethear api and show the specefic 
- data that we want to us . for this code i actually didnt do that much and it was just filling the blanks
- thank you mr.nesari i guess, so i just used two methods for each data and show them to us. 

## testing and evaluation
-as i said you as the user just need to type a city and the application will show you the humidity and tempreture 
of the given city, i tested the code and didnt encounterd any bugs because as i said it was just a fil in the blanks 
assignment , but at the same time i learned alot about toolboxes and how do they work.
