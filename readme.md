# Weather App Assignment

## Introduction
-this assignment is an application that give us a brief information(humidity,tempreture) of a given city.

## design and implementation
- i used gradle and json for handling the data that computer recives from the wethear api and show the specefic 
- data that we want to us . for this code i actually didnt do that much and it was just filling the blanks
- thank you mr.nesari i guess, so i just used two methods for each data and show them to us. 

## testing and evaluation
-as i said you as the user just need to type a city and the application will show you the humidity and tempreture 
of the given city, i tested the code and didnt encounterd any bugs because as i said it was just a fil in the blanks 
assignment , but at the same time i learned alot about toolboxes and how do they work.

## what i used
this assignment had three major topics that we needed to learn before using the in our application
1.json;or javascript objet notation is a format and as way to storage data that i used to get the data 
from api in this application 
2.gradle; it is a toolbox that helps you build applications easily and it contains tool to help you compile and 
and package your code.
3.api; sorry for this one it is a lot harder to explain but basically you use api when you want to interact with a server
or site and it helps you with delivering and recieving the massage and data from the server.

## functions(methods)
this code contains three important functions first is the function that reads the name of the city from user
and i used the try and catch method if the user typed the right city so it doesnt crash and it recieves data 
about the city second i made double variable called answer that we use to get the temprature from the 
json format and show it to the user anmd the third one does the same vas second one but it has a integer variable
and it shows us the humidity of the current location
