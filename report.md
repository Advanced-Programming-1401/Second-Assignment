# Weather app assignment
## Introduction
In this assignment, we built a simple Java application that connects to a weather API and retrieves information about the current weather conditions of a given city.
## Design and Implemention
At first the city's name is passed to the getWeatherData method and it returns a string.Then the string is passed to getTemperature(or getHumidity, etc) method and we can get the information we want.
## Testing and Evaluation
To make sure the program works properly, I checked the results with the correct weather information of that city.
## Conclusion
This assignment helped me to learn how to use JSON objects.
